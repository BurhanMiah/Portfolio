        <h2><u>About:</u></h2>
        <p>
I am a dedicated second-year sixth form student at Fitzalan High School, studying Welsh Baccalaureate, ICT, Business, and Sociology. My passion for business and technology drives my academic journey. Outside of school, I enjoy playing computer games, which enhance my strategic thinking, and football, which builds my teamwork and leadership skills. I work as a Customer Service Assistant at Little India Balti LTD, where I manage orders, interact with customers, and assist in various kitchen tasks, gaining valuable experience and a strong work ethic. I am committed to personal growth and look forward to applying my skills in future opportunities.
